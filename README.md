## UK federation Aggregator Beans

This project contains a collection of beans supporting metadata aggregation for the UK federation, based on the [Shibboleth metadata aggregator framework](http://shibboleth.net/products/metadata-aggregator.html).

As much as makes sense of the software developed here will be contributed to the main line Shibboleth MDA codebase once mature.

Some insight into the ways we're using these components in our [production deployment](https://github.com/ukf/ukf-meta) can be found in [this blog entry](http://iay.org.uk/blog/2012/08/uk-federation-metadata-aggregation).
